**Description**: Contributed and collaborated with project managers and developers on an e-commerce project called Sole Select - a sneaker trading website.

**Backend**: Go, Gin
**Database**: PostgreSQL, GORM
**Backend Deployed on**: Render

#Tools & Project Management
**Version Control**: GitHub

#Project Management:
 - Jira: We used Jira to assign and manage tasks with the product manager and other developers. We used Jira to plan a 4-week sprint to complete the e-commerce project and updated Jira daily after stand-ups.
 - Slack: We used Slack as a communication platform, by communicating in huddles and channels to share findings, progress and ideas.

**Key features**:

 -  Set up user authentication using JWT-based authentication.
 -  Users can place orders, view order history, update their cart and delete a product
 -  CRUD APIs.

Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge 1: Ensuring that expenses do not exceed the remaining salary, and handling cases where users input incorrect data.

Solution 1: Implemented data validation using Ginâ€™s bind JSON and custom error handling to provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency.

Challenge 2: Users must input their monthly salary before entering expenses to prevent errors.

Solution 2: Implemented a check for salary requirements before inputting expenses. An error will be displayed if expenses are entered first.

Results and Impact: Achieved a 95% satisfaction rate from 5 testing users.
